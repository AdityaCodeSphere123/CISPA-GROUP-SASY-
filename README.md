Welcome to my research and development repository from my internship at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, Germany.

## Internship Details
- **Intern**: Aditya Anand
- **Supervisor**: Professor Sajin Sasy
- **Institution**: CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, Germany
- **Project Focus**: Developing and optimizing oblivious BFS and DFS algorithms for graph data structures in Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) settings.

## Repository Overview
This repository contains:
- **Research Papers**: Key readings and foundational papers related to privacy-preserving graph algorithms, oblivious computation, and secure data structures.
- **Code**: All code developed during the internship, including:
  - Implementations and optimizations of oblivious BFS and DFS
  - Experiments and analysis scripts
  - Mathematical and empirical analysis of queue/compaction strategies
  - Visualization and plotting tools for algorithmic behavior
- **Documentation**: Summaries and explanations for each script and research direction

## Research Context
The main goal of this work was to design, implement, and optimize oblivious graph traversal algorithms (BFS and DFS) that can operate securely within a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment). This includes:
- Designing d-normalized graph representations for efficient oblivious access
- Implementing oblivious queue and array operations
- Analyzing and minimizing information leakage through access patterns
- Empirical and theoretical analysis of queue sizes, compaction, and performance
- Visualizing and benchmarking the algorithms on synthetic and real-world graphs

## Directory Structure
- **Research Papers/**: Contains all the reading material and foundational papers used during the internship (e.g., Oblix, OMIX, privacy-preserving Dijkstra, etc.)
- **Code/**: Contains all Python scripts, pseudocode, and analysis tools. See `Code/README.md` for a detailed summary of each script.

## Highlights
- Developed and tested efficient oblivious BFS and DFS algorithms for TEE settings
- Performed both theoretical and empirical analysis of queue/compaction strategies
- Created visualization tools to analyze algorithmic behavior and performance
- Summarized and referenced key research papers in the field

## Getting Started
To explore the code and experiments:
1. See `Code/README.md` for a summary of each script and its purpose
2. For plotting and analysis, ensure you have Python 3, `matplotlib`, and `numpy` installed
3. Research papers are available in the `Research Papers/` directory for further reading
